# Image-Optimization-Scripted
Gulp file and dependencies for scripted image optimization.

## Get Started
When you've a lot of images to optimize and don't want to use an online service or software with a UI...

1. Pull down this repository.
2. Install dependancies with `npm install`.
3. Place your original image files in the _originals_ directory.
4. Run `gulp`.

You'll end up with a new directory in your working directory named _dist_. Inside that directory will be your optimized images.
